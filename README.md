    <strong>A minimalist network fabric for your goroutines
    :link: :sparkles:</strong>
  </p>
</div>

* *Goroutinettes* :heart: are simple goroutines which are assigned a *name*
and are exposed on a *fabric* :link: 
* *Fabrics* :link: are meshes of Golang processes &mdash; potentially
distributed over multiple machines &mdash; facilitating
*flow* :ocean: establishment.
* *Flows* :ocean: are bidirectional communication channels between
  a *client* and a *Goroutinette* :heart:

## How it works

The first thing to do is to initiate a `Fabric` :link:,
and makes it `Fabric.Join` an existing mesh. Under the hood,
it will use a UDP gossip protocol to discover
members of the Fabric :link: and exchange *Goroutinettes*' :heart: name.
Our host should converge quickly and discover which
*Goroutinettes* :heart: (and `Host`s) are available in the `Fabric` :link:.

Then, for the actual data-plane, `Host`s are *lazily* peered together using
[*Connect RPC*][better-grpc]'s HTTP/2 bi-di multiplexed streams.

*Goroutinettes* :heart: can then be exposed on the
`Fabric` :link: and start accepting `Flow`s :ocean:.
Those are allocated on demand by *clients* and
are implemented on-top of:

* Go channels if the destination *Goroutinette* :heart: is in
  the same `Host`. (Value is still *copied*.)
* Inter-`Host` streams, encapsulated in a custom protobuf-encoded structure.

And *voil√†*, your goroutines can communicate even if they are not in
the same process &mdash; or even, on the same machine! :nerd:

## Design Principles

The `goroutinettes` framework is:

* Anti-Fragile :shield:
* Scalable :rocket: 
* Minimalist :seedling:

### Anti-Fragile :shield:

I avoided using a strongly consistent protocol since the `Fabric`
should be **anti-fragile**, and capable of running on top of a sh.. low-quality
network. APIs MUST NOT model an *infallible* `Fabric`:
this doesn't exist. Hence, users MUST be ready to handle
network errors, so they can build an anti-fragile, fault-tolerant distributed
system on top of `goroutinettes`.

### Scalable :rocket:

Furthermore, not having a heavy consensus protocol allows us to
**scale** horizontally aggressively. It SHOULD be pretty easy to build
a *gateway* to inter-connect two independant `Fabric`s. At scale, this
will likely be needed to avoid having full-meshing. This SHOULD allows really
flexible topologies.

### Minimalist :seedling:

Finally, I don't want `goroutinettes` to become bloated.
It should be a fundational network library **focused** on the Golang runtime
capabilities. Namely, goroutines are really central to the library: the runtime
is multiplexing I/O nicely and provides a sufficiently competent `net` package.

Dependencies SHOULD be *kept* minimal, actually, I can enumerate them:

* [`hashicorp/memberlist`][dep-mbl], for the UDP Gossip protocol of the `Fabric`s.
* [`go-logr/logr`][dep-gll], to let you chose how to treat *structured logs*.
* [`bufbuild/connect-go`][dep-con], used for `Fabric`'s `Host`s peering.

The choice of *Connect* over *gRPC* is a direct consequence of this principle.
gRPC has a maximalist design which is not compatible with my vision. If you want
to understand it better, I invite you to read [this article][better-grpc] which
will do a better job than me explaining why. Anyway, this choice mades me
divide by two our number of dependencies.
