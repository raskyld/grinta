<div align="center">
  <h1><code>gorounette</code></h1>

  <p>
    <strong>A minimalist, high-performance, go routines fabric :link:
    for your :heart: distributed systems :sparkles:</strong>
  </p>
</div>

I needed a way to distribute goroutines over multiple nodes and make
them talk to each other. So I *Just Made It Work* :tm:.
